## CS419

This is a course project done for CS419(M) : Introduction to Machine Learning. I implemented 3 widely used methods to build a movie recommender system namely, collaborative filtering, content based filtering and a hybrid model which combines both content based and collaborative filtering to recommend movies to a particular user. To do, this I first get the list of top 30 recommendations and then reorder them again.

The dataset that I used can be found here : [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OZQMnEniVKClrBYNL97e2JWfTtf32cy-?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OZQMnEniVKClrBYNL97e2JWfTtf32cy-?usp=sharing)
