## CS419

This is a course project done for CS419(M) : Introduction to Machine Learning. I implemented 3 widely used methods to build a movie recommender system namely, collaborative filtering, content based filtering and a hybrid model which combines both content based and collaborative filtering to recommend movies to a particular user. To do, this I first get the list of top 30 recommendations and then reorder them again.

The dataset that I used can be found here :
